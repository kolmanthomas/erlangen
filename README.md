**The Pappus Chain, built using inversive geometry**

Erlangen is a Python library that implements the hierarchy of geometries established in the original Erlangen program, a research project carried out by Felix Klein in the 1870s (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen_program).
More concretely, Erlangen implements the following geometric transforms:

- Euclidean transforms (isometries)
- Affine transforms
- Mobius and inversive transforms
- Hyperbolic transforms
- Elliptic transforms

by reducing all of the computations down to projective geometry.
